# SpriteShrink: Efficient ROM Deduplication and Archiving

SpriteShrink is a CLI utility for managing collections of retro game ROMs. By employing data deduplication across various file versions (e.g., regional variants, revisions), it achieves higher compression ratios than conventional methods, reducing storage for each multi variant game.

It also includes `lib_sprite_shrink`, a Rust library for integration into applications like emulators or frontends, enabling direct ROM extraction from archives.

## Features

* **Content-Defined Deduplication**: Uses the FastCDC algorithm to analyze multiple files in order to identify and eliminate shared byte data, storing only unique copies. This is achieved using the **FastCDC** content-defined chunking algorithm.
* **High Compression Ratios**: Achieves superior space savings by leveraging shared dictionary compression with **Zstandard** in addition to the deduplication.
* **Flexible Archiving**: Consolidates deduplicated data into a single, highly compressed archive file.
* **Parameter Auto-Tuning**: Automatically tunes chunking and compression parameters to find an optimal balance between compression speed and file size.
* **Data Integrity**: Internally uses **SHA-512** hashing to verify that every extracted file is a byte-for-byte perfect copy of the original. Upon decompression it will also verify each file to ensure no corruption occurred since the creation of the archive.
* **Metadata Inspection**: View a list of all files contained within an archive, along with their original filenames, sizes and indices.
* **Precise Extraction**: Extract one or more specific files from an archive by index.
* **Developer-Friendly Library**: A dedicated Rust library (`lib_sprite_shrink`) exposes core functionalities for easy integration into third-party applications.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Fully functional on 64-bit Linux, macOS, and Windows on x86-64 and AArch64 architectures.
* **Resource Control**: Options to limit CPU thread usage and enable a low-memory mode for resource-constrained environments.

## Intended Use Cases and Limitations

SpriteShrink is specifically designed for collections of files that are relatively small and share portions of data. The ideal use case is managing variant versions of a single game in your library or multi-disc games that contain duplicate data.

While it is technically capable of processing any file type, it is **not recommended** for:
* **Files with Little Redundancy**: Collections of files that do not share common data (e.g., a directory of unrelated documents or videos).
* **Encrypted or Pre-compressed Files**: Games that internally use their own compression, have a significant amount of encrypted data or contain a large amount of compressed video data.

The tool's content-defined chunking and deduplication algorithms provide the most benefit when byte-level similarities exist across multiple files, which is common in ROM sets with different regional versions and revisions.

**However**, despite these limitations, SpriteShrink shines in specific scenarios, such as multi-disc games. I have tested it specifically on my copy of Final Fantasy 7 which is three discs. Despite being one contiguous game across the three discs, there is a fair amount of assets used across all the discs that are duplicated should the player return to earlier parts of the game. Even though the discs differ, SpriteShrink achieved a 1:2 compression ratio on my copy—outperforming CHD and standard zstd archiving. So in the end the SpriteShrink size is smaller than what CHD with cdzs or a tar file using zstd at compression level 19 could manage.

## The .ssmc and .ssmd File Format

SpriteShrink uses custom archive formats called **SpriteShrink Multi-Cart (`.ssmc`)** or **SpriteShrink Multi-Disk (`.ssmd`)**. These formats are specifically designed for the efficient storage of file collections with a high degree of redundant data, such as ROM sets with multiple regional versions or revisions.

By using content-defined chunking and deduplication, the `.ssmc` and `.ssmd` format stores each unique piece of data only once, leading to significant storage savings compared to traditional compression tools.

A complete technical document detailing the binary layout, data structures, and design principles of the format is available for developers and enthusiasts.

## How It Works

The compression process follows a multi-stage pipeline to ensure maximum efficiency:

1.  **Chunking**: Input files are broken down into variable-sized chunks using the **FastCDC** content-defined chunking algorithm. This method ensures that identical segments of data produce identical chunks, regardless of their position in a file.
2.  **Deduplication**: Each chunk is hashed using **xxh3**, and only one copy of each unique chunk is stored in a `data_store`. This significantly reduces redundancy across multiple files.
3.  **Verification**: A **SHA-512** hash is generated for each input file to ensure data integrity when the archive is made.
4.  **Dictionary Training**: A compression dictionary is generated from samples of the unique data chunks. This dictionary helps the Zstandard compression algorithm achieve better ratios on the specific data being archived.
5.  **Compression**: The unique data chunks are compressed in parallel using the generated dictionary.
6.  **Archiving**: The compressed chunks, file manifest, and header are serialized and written to a final archive file.

## Usage

SpriteShrink is a command-line interface (CLI) tool. All interactions are done via flags and arguments.

### Basic Commands

* **Compress Files**:
    Compress a directory of files into a new `.ssmc` archive:

    ```bash
    ./sprite_shrink -i ./path/to/files/directory -o ./output/my_collection.ssmc
    ```

* **Extract Files**:
    First, list the contents of an `.ssmc` archive to find the file indices:

    ```bash
    ./sprite_shrink -i ./output/my_collection.ssmc -m
    ```

    Then, extract specific files by their index (e.g., extract index 1 and 3):

    ```bash
    ./sprite_shrink -i ./output/my_collection.ssmc -o ./extracted_files/ -e 1,3
    ```

## Error Handling & Reliability

SpriteShrink is designed to be robust. It gracefully handles malformed inputs, ensures data integrity (byte-for-byte identical extraction), and provides clear, actionable error messages. Operations are atomic, meaning partially written output files are automatically cleaned up in case of cancellation or failure.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Have a question? It may be answered here! Check here before asking elsewhere for (hopefully) a quick answer.

**Q: I used the `--optimize-dictionary` flag and the application used a bunch of RAM and crashed! Shouldn't that be fixed?**
  
  A: As noted in the command's help text, this option is considered experimental. It uses a feature of the underlying Zstandard (zstd) library that can consume a large and unpredictable amount of memory, which may lead to a crash on some systems. It is recommended to use this with caution.
  
  
**Q: Why was the compression ratio low when I archived a large collection of ROMs into one archive file?**
  
  A: SpriteShrink achieves its high compression ratios by finding and eliminating redundant data between similar files, like different versions or regional variants of the same game. When used on a large library of unrelated files, there's very little duplicate data to find between each distinct game, so the space savings will be minimal. For best results, use it on a per game basis, as detailed in the [Intended Use Cases and Limitations](#intended-use-cases-and-limitations) section.
  

**Q: Should I provide `.zip` files as input, or the uncompressed ROMs?**
  
  A: You should always provide the raw, uncompressed files (e.g., .iso, .bin, .sfc) directly to SpriteShrink. The tool's main advantage is finding redundant data inside the files themselves. If you pre-compress your ROMs into .zip or .7z archives, their content becomes scrambled from SpriteShrink's perspective, and it will not be able to find any duplicate data, leading to poor results.
  
  
**Q: How is this different from general-purpose archivers like 7-Zip, WinRAR, or `tar.zst`?**
  
  A: General purpose archivers typically compress each file individually using a finite data window. SpriteShrink, on the other hand, is a deduplicating archiver that compares data across all files in the set. It analyzes a group of similar files and stores any shared data chunks just once. This content-defined chunking approach is what allows it to achieve significantly better compression ratios on its intended content, such as multiple regional versions or updated variants of the same game.
  
**Q: What should I do if compression fails with a hash verification error?**
  
  A: A hash verification error indicates a rare "hash collision" occurred during the deduplication process. While uncommon, you can typically resolve this by increasing the hash size. Try running the command again with the --hash-bit-length 128 flag. This uses a larger hash, making collisions far less likely.
  
  
**Q: When should I use `--auto-tune`?**
  
  A: The --auto-tune flag is useful when you want to achieve the absolute best compression ratio for a set of files and are willing to wait longer (usually significantly longer for larger data sets). It automatically tests different chunking and dictionary size parameters to find the optimal combination. For most cases, the default settings provide a good balance of speed and compression, but --auto-tune is ideal for archival purposes where file size is the top priority.
