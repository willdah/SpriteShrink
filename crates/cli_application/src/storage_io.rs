//! Provides all file system input/output operations for the application.
//!
//! This module abstracts the complexities of interacting with the file

//! checking for file and directory existence, organizing input paths,
//! and collecting all files from a set of directories. All functions are
//! designed to be robust and provide clear error handling.

/// Reads the entire metadata block (manifest, dictionary, and chunk index)
/// from an archive file into a single byte vector.
///
/// This function leverages the information provided in the `FileHeader` to
/// determine the starting offset and the total contiguous length of the
/// metadata block within the archive. It then uses `read_file_data` to
/// efficiently retrieve this block without loading the entire file into
/// memory.
///
/// The metadata block is contiguous in the file, according to the file
/// specification, immediately following the header and consisting of the
/// manifest, dictionary, and chunk index in that order.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `file_path`: A `Path` pointing to the archive file from which the
///   metadata block is to be read.
/// * `header`: A reference to the `sprite_shrink::FileHeader` which contains
///   the necessary offset and length information for the metadata sections.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A `Result` which is:
/// - `Ok(Vec<u8>)` containing the complete metadata block as a byte vector.
/// - `Err(CliError)` if the file cannot be opened, seeking fails, or reading
///   the specified range of bytes encounters an I/O error.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// This function can return an error primarily if `read_file_data` fails,
/// which can happen due to:
/// - `CliError::Io` if the file specified by `file_path` cannot be accessed,
///   if seeking to `header.man_offset` fails, or if the number of bytes
///   indicated by `total_length` cannot be read from the file.
